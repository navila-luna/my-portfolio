      <h1> Nicole Avila's</h1>
      <img src="images/Nicole.jpeg">
      <p> Hello there! My name is Nicole Avila and I'm a rising 3rd year at the University of Chicago.
          I am majoring in Computer Science and considering minoring in Data Science.
          I was born in Houston, Texas but I've lived the majority of my life in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
         My parents are from San Luis Potosi, Mexico and they came to the United States for an opportunity
         to provide my siblings and I a better life. Thanks to my parents, I speak Spanish and had a lot yummy 
         Mexican food like enchiladas while growing up.       
      </p> 
      
      <h2> What Got Me Interested in Computer Science</h2>
      <p> The movie Hidden Figures told the story of three women that defied the odds by creating a series of coded algorithms 
          that played an essential role in launching a man into orbit. 
          Knowing that it happened in real life gave me the courage to learn Java in my sophomore year of high school. 
          Here, I was exposed to the creativity and possibilities that came with coding. 
          My interest and past research on mental health among adolescents led to my passion in designing 
          a website that would help empower individuals to track their daily mental health habits. 
      </p>
      <h2> Hobbies</h2>
      <p> I enjoy being outside with friends. I particularly like going out in trails either for a run or a hike.</p>
      <h2> Fun Facts</h2>
      <p>I absolutely <bold>LOVE</bold> raspberries and all kinds of berries. When I'm at the university, my 
         mornings are brightened by the sigth of raspberries I fill up in my plate from the dining hall. <br> 
        Apart from berries, I love birds. I spent a lot of my time outside with my parrots and dogs. After time
        I was able to impersonate their calls and from there other kinds of birds from the wild.

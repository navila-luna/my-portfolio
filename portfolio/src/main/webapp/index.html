      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> Hello there! My name is Nicole Avila and I'm a rising 3rd year at the University of Chicago.
          I am majoring in Computer Science and considering minoring in Data Science.
          I was born in Houston, Texas but I've lived the majority of my life in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
         My parents are from San Luis Potosi, Mexico and they came to the United States for an opportunity
         to provide my siblings and I a better life. Thanks to my parents, I speak Spanish and had a lot yummy 
         Mexican food like enchiladas while growing up.       
      </p> 
      
      <h2> What Got Me Interested in Computer Science</h2>
      <p> The movie Hidden Figures told the story of three women that defied the odds by creating a series of coded algorithms 
          that played an essential role in launching a man into orbit. 
          Knowing that it happened in real life gave me the courage to learn Java in my sophomore year of high school. 
          Here, I was exposed to the creativity and possibilities that came with coding. 
          Through my AP Research class in high school, I was able to see the connection between my interest in human behavior, 
          research, and computer science. AP Research enabled me to conduct original research on whatever intrigued me. 
          My interest and past research on mental health among adolescents and college students led to my project idea of designing 
          a website that would help empower individuals to track their daily mental health habits. 
      </p>

      <h2> Fun Facts</h2>
     <p> I am a crazy bird lover! Growing up, I spent the majority of my time outside with my parrots and dogs. After time
        I was able to impersonate their calls and birds from the wild. I was known to go to talent shows and just 
        surprise people with my bird calls.
